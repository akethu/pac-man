Recreation of the famous arcade game: 'Pac-Man'!

## Current Features

Players can compete by trying to collect all the coins as fast as possible using the arrow keys. Includes features such as:
- Timer 
- Pilot-control
- Automatic scroll-lock 
- Scoreboard 
- Alerts
and more.

## Upcoming Features

I am soon to add an AI ghost, which randomly moves around the game board. The player has to avoid the ghost and collect all the coins at the same time. I also plan to make the game board bigger.
